# RustysHosting

A side project I started in 2019, the goal was a fully functional Rust Server Hosting Website with integration with Stripe. 
* Used https://github.com/SergeyTsalkov/brooce as job queue
* Fully automated server provisioning
* Servers were Debian, jobs were ran as bash scripts
* Full integration with stripe, including payment cancellation, trial periods, discounts and monthly recurring subscriptions
* Responsive Design Index page (Wasn't practical for Control Panel)
* Control Panels Features
  * Remote Console
  * Scheduled Backups
  * Backup Management
  * Full configuration from web console
  * Useful tools such as map wipe, inventory wipe, plugin installation etc for Rust Servers

Completed but wasnt able to continue hosting due to lack of customers. Public for portfolio purposes. All secret keys/sensitve data has been rolled.
