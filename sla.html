  <h3>Service Level Agreement</h3>
<strong>Reimbursement</strong>
At any point that our Service Level Agreement (SLA) is not met, we offer a credit to customers at 100% of the last month or 30 days of services, whichever is most applicable. This credit does not stack for multiple outages on the same billable service and can only be redeemed once per month or 30 days of service. The maximum amount of credit redeemable in a single calendar month shall not exceed one month, or 30 days of service, whichever is greater. Reimbursement not available to customers with a delinquent account or open/pending/refunded chargebacks. Reimbursement only available upon customer request, and must be requested within 30 days from the time you become eligible for credit.

<strong>Scheduled Maintenance</strong>
Our SLA does not include any guarantees for scheduled maintenance or downtime. For a maintenance window to be classified as scheduled, it must be published to customer 48 hours prior to the start time. Based on your email preferences, you may not get an email alerting you of the outage, however all customers can find a notice on their Profile/Service page or listed.

<strong>Hosting Infrastructure</strong>
The physical part of game server hosting involves thousands of dedicated servers in places all around the world, connected to dozens of networks carriers, and partners.

<strong>Network & Infrastructure</strong>
Tesseract Hosting Ltd partners with several vendors that provide 100% network & infrastructure availability guarantees, excluding any scheduled maintenance. Network uptime comprises the full function of all cabling, switches, routers, and network interchanges within our network. Network outages caused by upstream providers, such as your ISP, are not covered by our SLA. Network attacks such as Denial of Service or other malicious events are also not covered by our SLA. Network downtime exists if a customer's server is unable to transmit and receive data from any traffic on the assigned IP address for their services. Network downtime is measured by either our internal reporting system or the first conversation/chat/email from the customer describing the issue.

<strong>Hardware & Infrastructure</strong>
Tesseract Hosting Ltd offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee in any given month, for both the server hardware and the power & cooling infrastructure required to maintain service uptime. We guarantee the proper function of the hardware for both shared and dedicated server customers and will replace any components that fail at no cost to the customer. In the event that hardware components fail, the downtime is measured after the 4 hours from the initial report via either our internal reporting system or the first conversation/chat/email from the customer. This 4 hour window gives our partner datacenters time to identify, diagnose, and replace any failed hardware within a reasonable amount of time.

<strong>Software</strong>
There are millions of lines of code managing the game servers, the physical nodes, and the services to keep these systems online. This section covers our SLA for the software our dedicated development team write and the 3rd party software used by thousands of game servers.

<strong>Services</strong>
Tesseract Hosting Ltd provides a 99.9% uptime guarantee in any given month, for all back-end services related to rustyshosting.io and related services such as FTP and database services such as MySQL. Rustys Hosting outages are counted in full 5 minute increments where the service is unavailable or non responsive as reported by an independent 3rd party on our Status Page.

<strong>Game Server Guarantee</strong>
Tesseract Hosting Ltd offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee in any given month, for all official dedicated game server executables published by the game developer/publisher. These release and software are denoted with either "official" or "vanilla" tag within our system. A game server software outage would be valid in the situation that the game server process fails to start, crashes on regular gameplay, or does not allow the player to connect to the server. This is excluded by situations that involve the game server or save data being out of date with the latest version of a game, invalid server configurations, limitations set by the configuration of your server, intentional server crashes caused by players or owners, custom server configurations, or when your server is offline. The outage is measured by either our internal reporting system or the first conversation/chat/email from the customer describing the issue.

<strong>3rd Party Software/Game Servers</strong>
Tesseract Hosting Ltd cannot provide any SLA or guarantee for 3rd party software, mods, plugins, custom content, or other content published by a 3rd party. Because Tesseract Hosting Ltd has no power or control over the software, we cannot make any guarantees that it will operate bug free or will operate as intended. Tesseract Hosting Ltd is not responsible for any damages related to using 3rd party software with your game server services.
